    <p>Our coach was Jim Lansing - a truly great man who ispired all who played for him.
    <br>
    <p>Jim Lansing, an <strong>All-American end at Fordham University</strong> and a former varsity and club football coach there, died in his sleep last Saturday night at his home in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 81.</p>

     <p><strong>In 1940, when Fordham was a national football power, Lansing helped it to an 8-1 record and a trip to the Cotton Bowl, where it lost to Texas A&M, 13-12. In 1941, he led the Rams to another 8-1 record and the Sugar Bowl, where they beat Missouri, 2-0.</strong> 
        
        Jim Crowley, then the Fordham coach, called Lansing the best end he had ever coached. Before the Sugar Bowl game, William D. Richardson wrote in The New York Times, ''In addition to being one of the best though least publicized defensive players in the college ranks today, Lansing is a great pass receiver.''</p>
        
        <strong>In 1942, before Lansing assumed his duties as the team captain, he was called to active duty by the Navy Air Corps. served as a dive-bomber and fighter pilot and received the Distinguished Flying Cross.</strong></p>
        
        In 1946, he returned to Fordham for his senior season. He injured a shoulder in the opening game, ending his playing career.

        From 1947 until Fordham dropped football after the 1954 season, he was an assistant coach under Ed Danowski (another assistant was Vince Lombardi). From 1955 to 1961, Lansing coached at Blessed Sacrament High School in New Rochelle.</p>
